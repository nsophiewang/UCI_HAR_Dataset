# Code Book

This code book describes the variables and transformations used to create
the tidy data set `summarydata.txt`.

## Data Source

The data originate from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**
(UCI HAR Dataset).

Signals were collected from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
and processed into time- and frequency-domain features.

## Identifiers

- `subject`  
  Integer. Identifier of the subject who performed the activity (1–30).

- `activity_name`  
  Character. Descriptive activity name:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

## Measurement Variables

All remaining variables are **averages** of the original measurements,
calculated for each **subject–activity** combination.

Variable name components:

- `Time` / `Frequency`  
  Indicates time-domain or frequency-domain signal.

- `Body` / `Gravity`  
  Indicates whether the signal is body motion or gravity component.

- `Acceleration` / `Gyroscope`  
  Type of sensor measurement.

- `Jerk`  
  The rate of change of acceleration (not an abbreviation).

- `Magnitude`  
  Magnitude of the three-dimensional signal.

- `Mean`  
  Mean value of the measurement.

- `Std`  
  Standard deviation of the measurement.

- `X`, `Y`, `Z`  
  Signal axis.

### Example Variable Names

- `TimeBodyAccelerationMeanX`  
- `TimeBodyAccelerationStdY`  
- `FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMeanZ`  
- `TimeBodyAccelerationJerkStdX`

## Transformations Performed

1. Training and test datasets were merged.
2. Only mean and standard deviation measurements were retained.
3. Activity codes were replaced with descriptive activity names.
4. Variable names were cleaned and expanded for readability.
5. The mean of each variable was calculated for each subject and activity.

## Final Tidy Data Set

- Each row represents **one subject performing one activity**.
- Each column represents **the average of a measurement variable**.
- The dataset satisfies the principles of tidy data.
